That rolls nicely into what I had to say anyway...There are five major cities here in Unrest. Currently you are at Waypoint Citadel...Though Waypoint Citadel is a collaborative city of the other four. A hub, of sorts. As a result, there is no citizenship for Waypoint Citadel, so you will need to move to one of the other four cities eventually. We use the questionaire as a basis to recommend you to the city you would fit in the most at, in this case, either the Bastion of Life, which is located across a marsh, a forest and plains. They are simplier and hard working folk and produce the majority of food for all of Unrest. I&#039;ve been led to believe it is a similiar place to some locations in Equestria. The other place I would recommend you to is the City of Tomorrow, an advanced city built into the side of a mountain up in the snowy tundras. They are interested in anything of a mechanical nature and are by far the most technologically advanced. If you like mechanics and learning new things, you will love being there. As for the other cities, Baribria is more of a magically focused city, and is a flying fortress out in the desert. They value academical and magical pursuits above all and have strict laws. The last...Is Finrest. Just...Don&#039;t go there. The men in charge there are corrupt and for every hardworking person unfortunate enough to be stuck there is a criminal who would take advantage of you for being new.

Aside from the fair share of standard pony variants, alongside the Lamia Creo caught a glipse of earlier, there are also some ponies who resemble a dragon quite strongly - The Kirin. Sporting additional horns, talons, leaner and more muscular frames along with dragon-like wings, if the Lamia were the main course in the list of tough things to swallow the Kirin were almost certainly the dessert for someone from Equestria.[br][br] The train would arrive after thirty minutes or so.

A black obi with a green trim and odd-question mark hold together the pony&#039;s black kimono closed, the orange flowers stringing together the rest of the attire. Lastly, solid green leggings make up the pony&#039;s hindquarters.[br][br] As she sits, she telekinetically floats her sheathed sword hanging from around herself away from her body, an odd feat for someone who is lacking a horn. She sets the sheathed sword down in her lap, the ornate and impractical hilt housing an orange gemstone pointed toward Creo. The tiniest part of the blade exposed to Creo is glowing a fierce orange.
